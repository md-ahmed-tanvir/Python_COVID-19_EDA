ü¶† Python COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
üìå Project Overview
This project explores the global spread and impact of COVID-19 using Python. The first known case of COVID-19 was reported on December 1, 2019, caused by a novel coronavirus later named SARS-CoV-2. Likely originating in animals and mutating to infect humans, the virus led to a global health crisis.

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic, citing over 118,000 confirmed cases across more than 110 countries and territories.

üß∞ Python Libraries Used
This analysis utilizes a wide range of Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and mapping:

pandas ‚Äì for data handling and preprocessing

numpy ‚Äì for numerical operations

matplotlib ‚Äì for static plotting

datetime ‚Äì to handle date/time formatting

plotly ‚Äì for interactive visualizations

folium ‚Äì for interactive geographic maps

math, random ‚Äì for basic mathematical and stochastic operations

üîç Next Step: Data Exploration
In the following sections, we will:

Load and clean the data

Analyze global trends over time

Visualize confirmed, recovered, and death cases

Map the geographic distribution of the virus

Identify country-level trends and outliers

Stay tuned for the data-driven journey through one of the most impactful events of our time.
